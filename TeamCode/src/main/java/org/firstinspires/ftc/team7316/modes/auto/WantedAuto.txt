1. new phone location
    - front of robot
    - tilted accordingly to see marks if possible
2. unable to put phone in location?
    - back up into balancing stone to see vumark on red side
3. close red side distances should be cool and good after vision testing. switch to blue side
4. variables for blue side should stay consistent
5. if the phone was moved to front and can see vumark, then close blue side is cool and good
    - if not, then shit, we'll have to drive fucking forwards and the back
